                The H'mong people living on the Dong Van stone plateau are always proud that they have two traditional occupations that make the community of other ethnic groups respect, namely the weaving of linen and the unique craft of blacksmithing. If blacksmithing is only for men, linen weaving is for women and they have created a colorful brocade culture among the gray stones of the barren highlands.

                Nestled between the misty rocky peaks of four seasons covered with clouds, Tung Tam Linen Weaving Village is the residence of the Mong ethnic people, famous for their hand-woven linen weaving, indigo dyeing and beeswax painting. Here people believe that "only by wearing linen, we will not lose our ancestors..." so linen has a special value in their cultural life. They use linen to make pants, shirts, skirts, scarves.... Mong girls to get married must have a linen dress and shirt. When they die, the Mong people must be buried with linen clothes to be "received by their ancestors". It can be said that costumes are their most characteristic cultural feature, showing the sharpness and individuality of individuals and communities. They make their own conventions with each other, just by looking at the costumes, they will know whether the wife, the woman is skillful, good at it, or not.
